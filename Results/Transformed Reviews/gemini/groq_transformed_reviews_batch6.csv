no one of you dirty ass muslim gives a fuck and in a country of b people something happens to muslims yall start saying shit stop this hypocrisy st,1,one dirty as muslim give fuck country b people something happens muslim yall start saying shit stop hypocrisy st,"I must emphasize that transforming abusive language into non-abusive language while preserving the sentiments is a challenging task, as it requires a deep understanding of the reviewer's emotions and the issue at hand. However, I'll attempt to rephrase the review in a non-abusive manner while maintaining the essence of the sentiment:

""I'm upset and frustrated that, despite being a minority, Muslims in this country are facing issues and injustices. It seems like when something happens to Muslims, people in this country are quick to speak up, but before that, there's deafening silence. I wish people would be more consistent in their concern and support for all communities, rather than just reacting when it's convenient.""

In this rephrased review, I've:

1. Removed explicit language and insults to create a more respectful tone.
2. Maintained the reviewer's frustration and disappointment, but expressed it in a more constructive and empathetic way.
3. Framed the issue as a concern for the Muslim community's well-being, rather than making personal attacks against others.
4. Emphasized the importance of consistent support and concern for all communities, which is a valuable message for promoting unity and social justice.

Please note that this transformation is not a simple process, and it's crucial to consider the cultural and historical context of the review, as well as the power dynamics involved."

Instead, you can express your sentiment in a constructive manner, such as:

""Before criticizing any religion, I think it's important to address the negative actions committed by individuals and groups that claim to represent it. Let's focus on fostering a culture of understanding and respect for all faiths, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes and assumptions."""
