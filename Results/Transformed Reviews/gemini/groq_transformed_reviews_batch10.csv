Here's a rewritten version of the review that is non-abusive and constructive:

""I'm unsure what to make of these opinions, as they seem unclear and disconnected from the topic. As a person with a unique perspective, I'd appreciate it if the author could provide more context or clarify what they mean by 'thermodynamic miracle.' Perhaps with further explanation, I could better understand their point of view.""

they could have just said queen of the dirty savage west indian monkeys,1,could said queen dirty savage west indian monkey,"A great exercise in constructive feedback!

Transformed review:
""I think they could have been more creative with their language. A phrase like 'Pioneer of the Wild West' or 'Fearless Adventurer' might have been a more fitting and accurate representation.""

Reasoning:

1. Instead of focusing on a negative, I emphasized a constructive aspect: being more creative with language.
2. I replaced the derogatory term (""dirty savage"") with a more positive and uplifting phrase (""Pioneer of the Wild West"").
3. I kept the essence of the original phrase, which still conveys admiration or respect for the subject."
